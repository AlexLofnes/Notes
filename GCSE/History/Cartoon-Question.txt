MESSAGE OF THE SOURCE
	The message of this souce is that the treaty of Versailles and the members who signed it was incredibly harmful to the Czech minorities shown as they want to be a part of Germany and therefore th German invasion is justified. It shows this through the representation of the treaty of Versailles as a beer which the Czech minorities do not like.


INTENDED AUDIENCE
	The cartoon was published in a Germany, meaning the main audience was Germans who would read newspapers or anywhere else this may be published.


PURPOSE OF THE AUTHOR
	The purpose is to convince the German people that the German invasion of Czechoslovakia is justified because the many minorities within Czechoslovakia are unhappy. The author wants people to feel bad for the minorities within Czechoslovakia as they are oppressed by the borders drawn up by Versaille and to feel proud that Germany was trying to take it back (the invasion began 2 months before this was published).


OWN KNOWLEDGE
The invasion began 2 months before this was published which is why I believe it was an attempt to convince people that the invasion was justified.
The treaty of Versailles drew new borders for Germany meaning there were many German speakers and people who felt German in the Sudentenland of Germany, which was used as a justification for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, as Hitler saw it as part of Germany.
