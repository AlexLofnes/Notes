## a) Describe Saddam Hussein's rule in Iraq. \[4]

Saddam Hussein's rule in Iraq came with massive improvements to quality of life, as his programs to nationalise many previously private industries gave the people of Iraq access to the best healthcare and education in the Middle East. He accomplished this by seizing and nationalising the oil of Iraq, which also partially thanks to an increase in the price of oil in 1973, gave the government far more money to invest into welfare.

However, along with these benefits for the population came massive repression, characterised by the increased military spending, to try to discourage any potential coups. Once he formally became president, he executed 22 party members for allegedly being part of a coup attempt and arrested 46 more. His rule was a violent and oppressive one, which increased the quality of life.

## b) Why was the Iranian Revolution of 1979 important to the West? \[6]

The Iranian Revolution was significant to the West because it saw the overthrowing of the Shah, a leader who had long been backed by the West and who had even been seen as an American puppet. By losing this connection to the Middle East, the West feared that oil prices would increase and their relationship to Iran may be damaged. This was also supported by one of the slogans of the revolution "Neither East nor West - Islamic republic!", which showed that the new Islamic republic was not trying to collaborate with the West.

The revolution was also important because it left the Shah with no home country whilst dying from cancer. He had been turned away from every country that he tried to enter until eventually the United States let him in. In retaliation the Iranians held 52 American dipolomats hostage for 444 days. This was significant not only because American citizens were being harmed, but President Carter would try a rescue mission, which failed, resulting in even more humiliation for the Americans.

The Iranian Revolution was also seen as a victory for Islamic fundamentalism, which was perceived as a threat to Western values and interests. The West was concerned about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and its potential to inspire similar movements in other Muslim countries. The revolution was seen as a signal that Islamic fundamentalism could challenge Western-style democracy and secularism, which had been the prevailing political models in the West since the Enlightenment.

## c) How suprising was the establishment of an Islamic republic in Iran by April 1979? Explain your answer. \[10]

One might argue that the speed of the revolution would take many people by suprise, as the Shah was overthrown in just a few months. The Shah fled Iran in January of 1979 and an Islamic republic was established in April of the same year. After an eruption of protests against the Shah, it took just weeks for the government to lose control of the streets, and the military begin to fracture. The speed of developement may have been suprising to some as these large social changes usually occur over long periods of time with slow and incremental change.

However, I believe that Islam had always played an influential role in Iranian politics and therefore a more authorotarian approach to religion should not have come as a shock to anyone. As shown by Iraq years earlier, having a strong leader who follows a populary ideology or religion for that area can be incredibly convincing to a population. The cult of personality and devoted following that Khomeini had gained showed the popularity of Shia Islam in Iran at the time, making it unsuprising when a government built around that religion was formed.

One might argue that the establishment of an Islamic republic in Iran was not at all suprising because the
