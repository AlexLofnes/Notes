## Prague Spring

## Solidarity

Soviet control of Poland was more problematic than that of other countries as they had a long history of conflict. Due to the **1973** oil crisis, living standards had declined. Many of the economic failures at the time were attributed to communist mismanagement. In **1980** an increase in the price of meat provoked a series of strikes by the trade-union, Solidarity, led by Lech Walesa.

#### Lech Walesa

*   Electrician from normal background
*   Brilliant organiser

### Demands

1.  Pay increase
2.  End of censorship
3.  Workers' benefits to match those of Communist Party members
4.  Allow broadcasts of Catholic Church on radio and TV

### Results

##### Positive

*   Demands were accepted
*   Membership at **9 million by Jan 1981**
*   Mass meetings where policies were discussed
*   Corruption was exposed
*   Government resigned

##### Negative

*   Military took over **(General Jaruzelski)** until **1989**
*   Walesa and **10,000** Solidarity leaders were jailed in **1981**
*   By **1985** many people thought that Solidarity had become a thing of the past

### Why these results?

1.  **Popularity** - Solidarity had **9 million** members as well as support from the Catholic Church, Communist Party had **3 million**
2.  **Workers' Movement** - It would seem anti-communist to shut down a democratic workers' trade-union
3.  **Support from the west** - Eg. Margret Thatcher said that Walesa was championing democracy
4.  **Walesa became a martyr** - Jaruzelski's use of force to break the union made Walesa into a figure of defiance against authoritarianism
